PhD in Software Engineering | Applied Data Mining & AI Development

I specialize in transforming data into actionable insights and production-ready applications, with a research focus on data mining and machine learning. My work bridges academic rigor with practical software engineering, resulting in several peer-reviewed publications.

My technical expertise lies in Python, data analysis, and the full stack of machine learning—from research and prototyping to deploying scalable solutions. I co-founded the E-Learning Department at Zand Institute, demonstrating my ability to lead and implement complex technical projects from concept to delivery.

Currently open to remote opportunities in:
• Data Science & Machine Learning Engineering
• Research Scientist / Applied Research roles
• Backend/Python development with a data focus
• Part-time or full-time engagements
